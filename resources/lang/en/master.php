With regard to financial resources and the operational costs of the establishment and management of the collection archive, or the library, the KHB has come up with a new concept of a comprehensive online database in 2018. Taking into account conditions for the exchange, dissemination and accessibility of information in the 21st century, it appears to be becoming a reality.',
